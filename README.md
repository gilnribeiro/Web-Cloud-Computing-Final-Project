To start the project, clone it to your local folder.
Before running the project, `cd` to `client-side` and then to `server-side` and run in both `npm install` to install the necessary packages.

Then, `cd` to the `server-side` folder in the project and run `nest start`, after starting the server side, `cd` to the `client-side` and run `npm start`.

You will soon have the project running on `localhost:3000` and the server running on `localhost:8080`
